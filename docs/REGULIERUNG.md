# Regulatory Context (NIS2, DORA, GDPR)

CyberLage maps security alerts into a regulatory context. These notes are guidance only and not legal advice.

## NIS2

- Focus: critical and important entities in the EU
- Core questions: incident relevance, reporting obligations, deadlines
- CyberLage marks alerts as **relevant**, **conditional**, or **not relevant** based on available alert data.

## DORA

- Focus: ICT risk management for the financial sector
- Core questions: service disruption, dependencies, reporting deadlines
- CyberLage uses contextual indicators to estimate DORA relevance.

## GDPR

- Focus: protection of personal data
- Core questions: personal-data impact, reporting obligations, 72-hour deadline
- CyberLage can flag potential GDPR relevance when data impact is visible.

## Reporting Obligation Note

CyberLage provides an **indicative** assessment. Final reporting obligations must always be validated by the responsible legal/compliance authority.
